# AtliQ Mart Supply Chain Analytics Project

## Problem Overview
AtliQ Mart, an up-and-coming FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India, presently operates in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodra. With ambitions to extend its reach to other metro/tier1 cities within the next two years, a notable issue has emerged. Several key customers opted against renewing annual contracts due to perceived service deficiencies. The suspicion is that essential products faced consistent delays or were not delivered in full, potentially resulting in subpar customer service. The company aims to address and rectify this issue before embarking on expansion. The supply chain analytics team, led by the recently onboarded data analyst, Peter Pandey, has been assigned the task of daily monitoring 'On-time' and 'In Full' delivery service levels for all customers.

## Tasks Assigned
In his role as the new data analyst on the supply chain team, Peter Pandey is tasked with:
1. Crafting metrics as specified in the metric list, including 'on-time delivery (OT) %,' 'In-full delivery (IF) %,' and 'OnTime in full (OTIF) %' daily, against the designated service level targets for each customer.
2. Designing a dashboard in alignment with the outlined requirements from the stakeholder business review meeting.
3. Transforming insights from the business review meeting into tangible metrics on the dashboard.
